## Want to try out the app?

Since this application was made for my usage and for learning purposes it is not available in the Google play store or Apple app store.

I have built and tested Sets & Reps only for Android. Download the apk file here: [Sets&Reps.apk](https://failiem.lv/u/z36zkdtdk?ak=8bb52)
